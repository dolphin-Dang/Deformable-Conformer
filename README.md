## Abstract
![Network Architecture](/visualization/Fig1.png)

- We propose a compact convolutional Transformer, EEG Conformer, to encapsulate local and global features in a unified EEG classification framework.  
- The convolution module learns the low-level local features throughout the one-dimensional temporal and spatial convolution layers. The self-attention module is straightforwardly connected to extract the global correlation within the local temporal features. Subsequently, the simple classifier module based on fully-connected layers is followed to predict the categories for EEG signals. 
- We also devise a visualization strategy to project the class activation mapping onto the brain topography.
